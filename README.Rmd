#Getting & Cleaning Data Course Project
May 2015

###Overview
From course assignment page:
<https://class.coursera.org/getdata-014/human_grading/view/courses/973501/assessments/3/submissions>

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following:

* Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
* Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
* From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Data Sets Used:
X_train.txt, Y_train.txt, subject_train.txt, 
X_test.txt, Y_test.txt, subject_test.txt, 
activity_labels.txt, features.txt

Data Set Overview:
"test" or "train" indicates whether the data are for  the test group or the training group
"x" indicates the measurements
"y" indicates the activity code
"subject" indicates the people being measured
"activity_labels" file - relates the six activity codes to the six
"features " file- names for each measurement column in x

###Process

Note: Source code is fully commented but I removed comments for the summary below

####Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Read the files into R data sets

```
xtrain<-read.table("X_train.txt")
ytrain<-read.table("Y_train.txt")
strain<-read.table("subject_train.txt")

xtest<-read.table("X_test.txt")
ytest<-read.table("Y_test.txt")
stest<-read.table("subject_test.txt")
```

Combine the data:
Stack (rbind) test and train data by data type: x, y or s
Add column names to the stacked datasets
Combine (cbind) the stacked datasets into one dataset
Add the activity names

```
strain$group<-"train"
stest$group<-"test"

alls<-rbind(strain,stest)
ally<-rbind(ytrain,ytest)
allx<-rbind(xtrain,xtest)

names(alls)<-c("subject","group")
setnames(ally,"activitycode")
names(allx)<-tolower(features[,2])

alls=alls %>% select(group,subject)

combo<-cbind(alls,ally,allx)
colnames(combo)
```

####Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 

Identify columns to keep:
Subject and activity, measurements of means ("mean")  or standard deviations ("std")
Add the activity names

```
cols<-grep("subject|group|activitycode|mean|std",colnames(combo))
cols

combokeep<-combo[,cols]
dim(combokeep)

names(activity)<-c("activitycode","activityname")
activity

combowithactivity<-merge(activity,combokeep)
dim(combowithactivity)
```

####Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
####Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 

Make the data tidy:
Drop redundant activity code column (1:1 with activity name)
Make the columns more readable by expanding the shortened name components and dropping special characters

```
names(combowithactivity)<-gsub("^t","time",names(combowithactivity))
names(combowithactivity)<-gsub("mag","magnitude",names(combowithactivity))
names(combowithactivity)<-gsub("^f","freq",names(combowithactivity))
names(combowithactivity)<-gsub("acc","acceleration",names(combowithactivity))
names(combowithactivity)<-gsub("gyro","gyroscope",names(combowithactivity))
names(combowithactivity)<-gsub("-","",names(combowithactivity))
names(combowithactivity)<-gsub("\\(","",names(combowithactivity))
names(combowithactivity)<-gsub("\\)","",names(combowithactivity))
names(combowithactivity)<-gsub("\\,","",names(combowithactivity))

combowithactivity<-arrange(combowithactivity,group,subject,activityname)
```

####From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set 
####with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Create the tidy summary dataset:
Calculate means for all mean and standard deviation measurement for each unique user and activity combination

```
DT <- data.table(combowithactivity)
DT$group<-NULL
mydata<-aggregate(.~subject+activityname,DT,mean)
mydata<-arrange(mydata,subject,activityname)
dim(mydata)

write.table(mydata,"mydata.txt",row.name=FALSE)
```

Create the codebook

```
cboutput<-codebook(data.set(mydata))
capture.output(cboutput,file="cb.txt")
```

Final data set is "wide tidy" per the discussion forum:
<https://class.coursera.org/getdata-014/forum/thread?thread_id=31>

Per Hadley's tidy data article (page four), data are tidy:
* Each variable forms a column (subject, activity, measurements)
* Each observation forms a row (unique subject and activity combinations)
* Each type of observational unit forms a table (means of normalized measurements)
